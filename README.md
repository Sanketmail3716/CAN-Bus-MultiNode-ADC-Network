# CAN-Bus-MultiNode-ADC-Network
This project demonstrates CAN bus communication using MCP2515 modules with multiple PIC microcontrollers (Node A, B, and C). Node A reads analog data from a sensor using ADC and transmits it to other nodes via CAN. Nodes B and C receive and display this data on 16x2 LCDs. Implemented using MikroC PRO.
